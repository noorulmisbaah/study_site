About The Project
#######################
The Mini Study Site project is a site where students can visit and have access to learning resources. For demonstration purpose, not all resources are currently available.
The site has an administrator who is responsible for adding new students, updating their information, and removing them. The administrator has access to all the available resources in the site. On the other hand, the students have access to only the resources available for their class.

Technologies Used
#######################
The Minu Study Site is a fullstact project. The frontend is powered by EJS, CSS, and JavaScript. The backend is powered by NodeJS, and ExpressJS. EJS view engine was used to enable easy server-side rendering.
